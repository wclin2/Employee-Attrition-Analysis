What this chart shows us is that as time continues, the organization's value increases while the emplyee become even more productive member.  
Let's simplify the plots and see what happen if an emplyee leaves

We can clearly find that as an employee leaves, organizations have to go through a period of hiring process, training process etc. In this period, the productivity is lost. Usually, some of the cost of attrition is hidden. It is hard to measure.  Next, we will define how to calculate the cost.

**Cost Calculation**  
- Direct Costs
- Productivity Costs (Hidden Costs)
- Salary + Benefits

**1. Direct Costs**  
| Item | Values |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Average Separation | $500 | 
| 2. Average Vacancy (Temporary Help, Overtime ...) | $10,000 | 
| 3. Average Aquasition (Ads, Travel, Interview ...) | $4,900 | 
| 4. Average Placement (New supplies, Training ...) | $3,500 | 
| Total (1. + 2. + 3. + 4.)| $18,900 |

**2. Productivity Costs (Hidden Costs)**  
| Item | Values |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Annual Revenue Per Employee | $250,000 | 
| 2. Workdays Per Year | 240 | 
| 3. Average Workdays Position Is Open | 40 | 
| 4. Average Onboarding / Training Period | 60 | 
| 5. Effectiveness During Onboarding / Training | 50% |
| Total (1. / 2. x (3. + 4. x 5.))| $72,917 |

**3. Savings of Salary + Benefits**  
| Item | Values |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Average Salary + Benefits | $80,000 | 
| 2. Workdays Per Year | 240 | 
| 3. Average Workdays Position Is Open | 40 | 
| Total (1. / 2. x 3.)| $13,333 |

Therefore, the **Estimated Attrition Cost Per Employee** would be **$78.483**  
If 200 employees turnover, it would cost the company **$15.7M Per Year**
